### Model part

_TODO_

### Syncing

Data is synced to clients with a simple diff/patching algorithm. It's not very fast but tested enough for tiny realtime apps.

### Rendering

On client side, [Respo](http://respo.site) is used to maintain DOM elements.

### Examples

Several projects created with Cumulo can be found on https://github.com/TopixIM/
